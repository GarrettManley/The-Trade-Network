The-Trade-Network
=================

YO, ok lets make this work

Will - get remove item to work and trade table
(remember to delete from trade table - not item)
(columns wanted - should be in gui - and if it doesnt work its in string constants)


Alex - get tradehistory to work
(same thing for columns)

Garrett - make the offers button work - make the panel etc so u can accept offers

I'll make search work again so you can offer things.

Until I get search to work(will update on github via readme) just insert test data into your own db.
